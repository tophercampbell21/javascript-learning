STRICT MODE
 - This statement has to be the very first statement in all of the JS pages if you want strict mode activated
 - This makes the code more secure, it helps us avoid adding accidental bugs
 - This will create visual errors instead of JS failing silently making it harder for us to catch bugs 
 - Strict mode will make it impossible for us to do certain things that it knows will not work 

*** I'm wondering if modern Javascipt automatically uses strict mode...
